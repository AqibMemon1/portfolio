Baja SAE compeition is an international off-road buggy design and manufacturing competition held in USA every year. I spearheaded the team (Team Markhor) in 2019 with the hopes of competing in the event but due to COVID-19 we were not able to compete in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we registered ourselves for our first competition and landed 4th position in the business presentation all over the world. Team Markhor is the only and first team from Pakistan that has competed in the SAE BAJA Competition.
I served as a team captain from 2019 to 2022 and I had the opportunity to enhance both my technical and soft skills.
