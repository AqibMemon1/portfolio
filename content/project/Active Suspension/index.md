This project provides an in-depth exploration of various automobile suspension systems, including independent and solid axle suspensions, further categorizing them into active and passive suspension setups. Additionally, we delve into the historical context and fundamental scope of active suspension technology. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, we introduce PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers and elucidate their key characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate how manipulating the PID controller parameters affects the system's behavior.
The project follows a systematic methodology for creating a mathematical model of an active suspension system. We begin by defining the problem and constructing various free body diagrams to visualize the forces at play. Subsequently, we derive equations and transfer functions, drawing from control theory principles and the information gleaned from the free body diagrams. These equations serve as the foundation for constructing a mathematical model in Simulink, allowing us to simulate the active suspension system's performance across different road profiles and with various types of controllers.
In addition to examining active suspension, we also scrutinize the response of passive suspension systems when subjected to different road profiles. This comparative analysis is instrumental in assessing the advantages and disadvantages of both active and passive suspension setups.
The culmination of the project involves a comprehensive comparison of all the controllers, along with the passive suspension system, through the presentation of graphical data. This data enables us to visualize and interpret the performance disparities among these systems effectively. Furthermore, we summarize the characteristics and attributes of each system in the form of concise tables, providing a clear reference point for understanding their respective merits and limitations. Through this project, we aim to shed light on the intricate world of automotive suspension systems, their controllers, and their effects on vehicle dynamics, thereby contributing to the broader knowledge in this domain.
