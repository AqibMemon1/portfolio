Turkish Aerospace Industries has been working on its 5th-generation fighter aircraft program for over a decade. I am intensively involved in the design process of the aircraft ranging from the design of control surfaces, actuators, mechanisms, physical mockup models, and prototyping using a range of technologies including 3D printing. Over the last few months, we have rigorously tested our mechanisms and actuators using 3D printing. The project will start its flight tests soon in the upcoming year (2024).
