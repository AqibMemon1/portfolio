At the end of 2021, I created a team for the IMechE UAS Challenge to compete in the UK. During my as team captain, we designed and manufactured a fixed-wing UAV for the competition but due to insufficient funds, we were not able to compete in the competition. Later on, in 2022, IMechE in my university and its members introduced the same challenge in Pakistan. Since then I have been working as an active member in the organizing committee of the competition. I look over the technical rulebook, and judging criteria, conduct webinars, and judge the designs of students participating in the competition.
