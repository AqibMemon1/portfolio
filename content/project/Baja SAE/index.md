In 2019, I assumed the leadership role within Team Markhor, an enthusiastic group of individuals with a shared passion for engineering and off-road vehicles. Our collective goal was to participate in the prestigious Baja SAE competition held annually in the United States. Our journey was characterized by dedication, determination, and the pursuit of excellence, but unforeseen challenges arose in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing us from competing in 2020 and 2021. Despite these setbacks, our spirit remained unwavering. 
In 2022, we seized the opportunity to register for our first-ever Baja SAE competition. It was a monumental moment for our team and a significant milestone for Pakistan, as we became the pioneers, the first and only team from our nation to compete on the global stage of Baja SAE. Our dedication paid off as we achieved an impressive 4th position in the highly competitive business presentation category, ranking among the top teams worldwide. During my tenure as the team captain from 2019 to 2022, I had the privilege of leading a remarkable group of individuals, each contributing their unique skills and expertise to our collective mission. Beyond the technical aspects of designing and manufacturing off-road buggies, I also witnessed a transformation within myself and my teammates as we honed our soft skills. Communication, teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving became second nature to us, enabling us to overcome adversity and reach our goals.
 The Baja SAE competition not only provided us with a platform to showcase our engineering prowess but also taught us invaluable life lessons. It taught us the power of resilience, the importance of adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges, and the significance of setting ambitious goals and working tirelessly to achieve them. Looking ahead, Team Markhor is poised to continue breaking new ground and representing Pakistan on the global stage of engineering excellence. Our journey is a testament to what can be achieved through teamwork, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of one's dreams. We remain committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation and fostering a culture of engineering excellence in our homeland and beyond.
