The usage of UAVs has risen tremendously in recent years because of improved avionics and propulsion technology; nonetheless, there is a lot of demand to improve the range, endurance, speed, and ergonomics of UAVs. Neither a fixed wing nor a multi-rotor can solve all of these issues. What's required is a mix of the two configurations, which may considerably expand the usage of drones in a variety of applications. Due to the requirement for emergency operations, a novel idea is being developed in which an aircraft can fly and land vertically like a helicopter or other multi-rotor, as well as fly ahead like a fixed-wing aircraft, combining the best of both configurations.
Our Hybrid VTOL UAV can take-off and land without a runway and hover in any required area with higher endurance and range than multi-rotor. Hence due to their ideal flight requirements for reconnaissance it can be used in military, disaster management, healthcare and mapping. In our project, a concept of a UAV is developed which is fully automated and can take off and land vertically with capability of performing a range of missions from product delivery to military reconnaissance. It is indigenous design made completely out of Carbon Fibre and 3D printed components.
