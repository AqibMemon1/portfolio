In different cities across Pakistan, we encounter various environmental conditions like high daytime temperatures and different levels of humidity. Additionally, we often don't have a clear idea of the conditions in which our products will be used. To address this challenge and model a wide range of scenarios, including factors like room size, number of people, lighting, solar radiation, and air infiltration, I developed a software program. This program has been created using MATLAB/SIMULINK/SIMSCAPE, and it allows users to input parameters through an Excel sheet. These parameters can be customized to represent different scenarios. The program then calculates the total heat entering the room from various sources and predicts how the room temperature will respond when a specific air conditioner (AC) is installed. By utilizing this software, we can recreate domestic conditions in our Split AC Lab, which helps us develop a reliable and market-ready product. This tool enables us to test our AC units under a wide range of circumstances, ensuring they perform well in real-world situations. Furthermore, we planned to make this software accessible to our customers through the Dawlance website and our Experience Centers. This way, customers can use the program to determine which AC product best suits their needs. They can input their specific requirements, and the software will suggest the most suitable AC unit, taking into account factors like room size and expected electricity costs based on the selected tonnage. This will empower our customers to make informed decisions when choosing an AC that fits both their needs and budget. In summary, this software program is a valuable tool for designing reliable AC units and assisting customers in selecting the right product to create comfortable living conditions while keeping electricity costs in check
