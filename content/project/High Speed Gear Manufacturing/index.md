Our project centered around assessing the feasibility of expanding gear manufacturing capabilities within the Qadri Group of Comapnies, a company known for its expertise in the sugar industry and its production of complete sugar mills. In addition to serving the sugar sector, the Qadri Group also manufactures parts for other industries like cement and automobiles. They were proficient in producing large gears with diameters of up to 6 meters, typically operating at speeds of 5-7 rotations per minute (rpm). However, they recognized the need to acquire the technology and expertise to manufacture high-speed gears. Our primary task was to create a comprehensive case study that would outline the necessary technologies and the associated investment required to enable the production of high-speed gears. To gauge the potential return on investment (ROI), we conducted an in-depth analysis of import data from various sugar and cement industries. This analysis allowed us to estimate the total market capital associated with gear imports, including both complete gear units and spare parts. Our findings indicated that this market was substantial, with an estimated capital of 1.5 billion PKR. As part of our project, we also provided quotations for the machines, manufacturing methods, and materials needed to produce both high-speed and intermediate gears. These quotations were designed to give Qadri Group a clear understanding of the costs and resources required to enter this new segment of gear manufacturing. In summary, our case study aimed to guide Qadri Group in making informed decisions about venturing into the production of high-speed gears. We assessed the market potential, identified the necessary technologies, and provided cost estimates to help them strategically expand their product offerings.
