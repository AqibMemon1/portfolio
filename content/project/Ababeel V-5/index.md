Ababeel VTOL-V5 is a conceptual long-range VTOL UAV for military reconnaissance, payload drop and surveillance missions. As a lead designer for the project, I was responsible for the design and manufacturing of the project including the designing of the outer mould line, aerodynamic performance, design of actuators and mechanisms, and control systems. The design is made completely out of carbon fibre using wet layup and vacuum bagging techniques. The most challenging part of the design was its tilt-wing and tilt-rotor mechanisms as we had to minimize the structural weight while having the capacity of mounting high thrust motors. Through intense prototyping by FDM 3D printing, we were able to come up with a working design.
