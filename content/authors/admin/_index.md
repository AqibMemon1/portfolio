Hello, I'm Aqib Habib, a professional Structural Design Engineer employed at Turkish Aerospace Industries. Additionally, I'm pursuing my education in the field of robotics and control systems at the National University of Sciences and Technology. My academic and professional journey converges on my passion for cutting-edge technology, particularly in the realms of aerial robotics, multi-agent control, and autonomous systems.

In my role as a Structural Design Engineer, I contribute to the development and advancement of aerospace technologies, ensuring that aircraft are not only structurally sound but also optimized for performance and safety. I am also responsible for prototyping mechanisms, parts and whole aircraft through mockup models and 3D printing to ensure that everything fits and works according to design intent. Every day brings new challenges as the requirements are dynamic and changing, and I have to adapt the design according to that.

My studies at the National University of Sciences and Technology aim to deepen my knowledge of robotics and control systems, allowing me to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications in the field. I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that can enhance the capabilities of aerial robotics and enable effective multi-agent control in various applications, ranging from search and rescue missions to precision SLAM.

I am enthusiastic about combining my engineering background and academic pursuits, as it equips me to contribute to the development of autonomous systems that have a meaningful impact on our society. I look forward to furthering my research and collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations to shape the future of autonomous technologies.
